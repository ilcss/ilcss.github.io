Social media has become a prominent device to organize social protests, deliver information to citizens, and develop collective narratives. However, not all messages spread equally across social media nor do they gain the same level of acceptance. Analyzing in detail social media data, our research explores a broad range of relevant social topics using cutting-edge computational methods. In a set of distinct projects, we discuss the relationship between the propagation of political messages, political polarization, and the integration of new media markets connecting social media users and traditional news organizations; explore the behavior of outlets' editors when responding to users preferences in a social media environment, and propose new methods to take in consideration spatial contagious, heterogeneous effects, and autocorrelation when dealing with big network data. Below, we present some of the publications related to this project.
