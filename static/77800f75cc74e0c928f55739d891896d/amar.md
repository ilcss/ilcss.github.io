The All Minorities at Risk (AMAR) project is an independent research project that monitors and analyzes the status and conflicts of around 1200 socially relevant communal groups—minorities and majorities alike—in countries with a population of at least 500K. The project is designed to provide information in a standardized format that aids comparative research and contributes to the understanding of politics including relevant groups.
\
\
The AMAR data project builds on the Minorities at Risk (MAR) data that was founded in 1986 by Ted Robert Gurr, one of the preeminent scholars of political violence and ethnic conflict. Following Ted Gurr the MAR project was led by Christian Davenport (2004-2006), Jonathan Wilkenfeld (2007-2010), and Jóhanna Birnir (2011-).

The current AMAR project is a collaboration between researchers at iLCSS, University of Michigan (led by Christian Davenport), and the Race and Ethnic Politics Lab at the University of Texas at Austin (led by Amy Liu and Eric McDaniel).
