EVE Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), played by over 7 million individuals from around the globe from 2003 to the present. Within this virtual world EVE users create characters and identities, plan careers, form relationships, and start and join organizations. For scholars, this setting provides extra-ordinarily rich data, the opportunity to observe nationals from 150+ countries interacting in a common space, and some unique but revealing situations such as contrasting real world and virtual genders. In a series of papers Birnir, Waguespack and Dunford examine the structure of companies founded in EVE, participation in violence, and career track signaling. Click here to acess the EVE Online game
