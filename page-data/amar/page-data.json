Following Ted Gurr the MAR project was led by Christian Davenport (2004-2006), Jonathan Wilkenfeld (2007-2010), and Jóhanna Birnir (2011-).\n<br>\n<br>\nThe current AMAR project is a collaboration between researchers at iLCSS, University of Michigan (led by Christian Davenport), and the Race and Ethnic Politics Lab at the University of Texas at Austin (led by Amy Liu and Eric McDaniel). </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"All Minorities at Risk (AMAR)"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/amar/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["295129247","3130270152","3649515864","4170912752"]}
